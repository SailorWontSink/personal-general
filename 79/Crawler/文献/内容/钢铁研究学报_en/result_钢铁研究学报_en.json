School of Mechanical, Materials and Mechatronic Engineering, University of Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia\n3. Technology Center, Shanxi Taigang Stainless Steel Co., Ltd., Taiyuan 030003, Shanxi, China Hot compression tests were carried out in the temperature range of 1223-1473 K and strain rate range of 0.01-30 s-1 to investigate the flow behavior and microstructural evolution of super duplex stainless steel 2507 SDSS2507. It is found that most of the flow curves exhibit a characteristic of dynamic recrystallization DRX and the flow stress increases with the decrease of temperature and the increase of strain rate. The apparent activation energy Q of SDSS2507 with varying true strain and strain rate is determined. As the strain increases, the value of Q declines in different ways with varying strain rate. The microstructural evolution characteristics and the strain partition between the two constituent phases are significantly affected by the Zener-Hollomon parameter Z. At a lower lnZ, dynamic recovery DRV and continuous dynamic recrystallization CDRX of the ferrite dominate the softening mechanism during the compression. At this time, steady state deformation takes place at the last stage of deformation. In contrast, a higher lnZ will facilitate the plastic deformation of the austenite and then activate the discontinuous dynamic recrystallization DDRX of the austenite, which leads to a continuous decline of the flow stress even at the last deformation stage together with CDRX of the ferrite."}, "http://www.chinamet.cn/Jweb_gtyjxb_en/CN/abstract/abstract148934.shtml": {"title_en": "Microstructure and Properties of Fe-Cr-C Hardfacing Alloys Reinforced with TiC-NbC", "author_en": "Hai-yun LIU,Zhi-liang SONG,Qing CAO,Shao-ping CHEN,Qing-sen MENG", "org_en": "College of Materials Science and Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan 030024, Shanxi, China"}, "http://www.chinamet.cn/Jweb_gtyjxb_en/CN/abstract/abstract148935.shtml": {"title_en": "Descaling Behavior of 430 Hot-rolled Stainless Steel in HCl-based Solution", "author_en": "Ying-ying YUE1,Cheng-jun LIU1,Pei-yang SHI1,Mao-fa JIANG1,Li-yan QIN2,Guang-wei FAN2", "org_en": "1.

After rolling, the structure of the sheet is likely to be heterogeneous along the normal direction. The microstructure and ordering evolution in the thickness range of the sheets during hot-warm rolling process was studied by means of optical microscope and transmission electron microscope. The results show that dynamic recrystallization occurs in the surface parts during the hot and warm rolling processes, where the grains are equiaxed but have high density of dislocations due to the large deformation. The grains in the center part are elongated along the rolling direction. It is also found that in the hot rolled sheet, the center part has lower density of dislocations because of dynamic recovery. Meanwhile, this part has higher ordering content compared with the surface part, indicating that the high density of dislocations can inhibit the formation of ordering in the air cooling process after hot rolling. In the warm rolling process, both of the parts are deformed heavily. Large deformation destroys ordered phases and induces disordering. The ordering content is low in the whole warm rolled sheet."}, "http://www.chinamet.cn/Jweb_gtyjxb_en/CN/abstract/abstract149045.shtml": {"title_en": "Phase Transformation of a Cold Work Tool Steel during Tempering", "author_en": "Hong-xiao CHI1,2,3,Dang-shen MA3,Hui-xia XU2,Wang-long ZHU2,Jian-qing JIANG1", "org_en": "1.
