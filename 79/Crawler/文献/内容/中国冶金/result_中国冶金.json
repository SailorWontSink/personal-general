It was found that the wave and the camber had a corresponding relationship. By analyzing the current situation of the visible wave shape and the invisible wave shape, it was found that there was a manual modification of the target crown setting value. A three-dimensional finite element model of the temper mill was established, and the stress distribution of the different strip crowns after rolling was compared and analyzed. By adopting the \"small crown + non-rolling through the temper\" measure, the average value of the camber defects was reduced from 15.2 to 4.97 mm. Due to the lower support roller transmission, the presence of the rolling zone in the strip deformation zone leaded to different stresses in the upper and lower surface of the strip, which caused the occurrence of C warp defects. This phenomenon was further verified by dynamic explicit finite element analysis.

According to charging radius variation with different burdens in their range of grain diameter and the size of drag force, the influence of gas drag force is important when computing the burden trajectory for achieving the optimal burden distribution.\ue003", "keywords_en": ["", "", "", "burden trajectory", "landing point"], "citation": ""}, "http://www.zgyj.ac.cn/CN/abstract/abstract9551.shtml": {"title_cn": "\u5efa\u7b51\u7528\u94a2\u6750\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u73b0\u72b6\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c55\u8d8b\u52bf", "author_cn": "WANG Si\ue011wei", "org_cn": "The Chinese Society for Metals, Beijing 100711, China", "abstract_cn": "", "keywords_cn": ["", "", ""], "title_en": "Production Status and Development Trend of Constructional Steel", "abstract_en": "", "keywords_en": ["", "", ""], "citation": ""}, "http://www.zgyj.ac.cn/CN/abstract/abstract9561.shtml": {"title_cn": "SVC\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u5de5\u4e1a\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u6d45\u6790", "author_cn": "LI Shi\ue011lin", "org_cn": "China Academy of Mechanical Sciences & Technology\uff0c Beijing 100044\uff0cChina", "abstract_cn": "", "keywords_cn": ["", "", "", "", ""], "title_en": "Relationship of SVC Technology Extension and Industrial Energy Saving", "abstract_en": "Abstract\uff1aSVC has fast, dynamic, smooth and continuous compensation characteristics of It also can generate positive and negative reactive power.

In the case of the circular turbulence inhibitor, the vortex center of flow field is near the bottom of the turbulence inhibitor, and the fluid flows vertically at the exit the of the turbulence inhibitor. The vortex is near the shroud, and the vortex center has the same height as the dam, so there is greater surface vibration, and sometimes slag entrapment occurs. The bottom of asymmetric square turbulence inhibitor has the wave form, and the vortex center is near the exit of the turbulence inhibitor, and the fluid flow obliquely at the exit the of the turbulence inhibitor. Because the exit area at the right side of the turbulence inhibitor is greater than that at the left side, the fluid flow rate at the right side is greater than that at the left side. And the larger the exit area of the turbulence inhibitor, the less the exit velocity of the fluid, and the more stable the free surface of the tundish. Water modeling showed that the difference of the average residue time between two strands in the case of asymmetric turbulence inhibitor is only 3/4 in the case of circular turbulence inhibitor, and the arithmetic mean of the average residue time increase 5.3 percent.

A three-dimensional semicircular cold model was established and the particle motion information was also obtained by using high-speed photography method to track the trace particle motion. The particle velocity scalar field was obtained through processing the large amount of particle motion information, and finally the irregular degree of raceway boundary defined by isolines under different particle velocity was discussed. The results show that the fractal dimension which is close to Euclidean dimension 1 remains unchanged in the cavity zone.

The bath mixing behavior was investigated with physical modeling experiments in laboratory.

It is shown from the laboratory experiments that the stirring ability in converter bath can be markedly enhanced and the bath mixing time be reduced greatly with top-bottom-side blowing technique. There is a critical side blowing gas flowrate. The bath mixing time hardly changes any more when the side gas flowrate is greater than the critical value. It is found from the results in industrial experiments that consumption of hot metal and scrap can be reduced and lime consumption of a ton of molten steel can be decreased by about 3kg in the TBS blown converter. It can enhance dephosphorization capability and lower oxidization of slag and liquid steel.

A more scientific and efficient shaft furnace magnetic roasting theory is put forward through the experimental research on haft furnace magnetic roasting of weakly magnetic lump iron ore.

The results show that the maximum effectiveness of magnetic roasting is obtained under the condition that the content of hydrogen reduction gas increases to 12%\u00b11%, the CO content decreases and the magnetic roasting reduction temperature rises. And by independently setting the reduction gas and heating gas system in the process of magnetic roasting, the flexible adjustment for reducing gas components, flow rate and pressure is achieved. Decreasing the amount of reduction gas to reduce the gas for reduction of ore to 1400- 1600m3/h can lower the production cost of shaft furnace. The independent reduction gas system can increase coke oven gas proportion of reduction gas and keep the H2 content and the magnetic susceptibility to 12%\u00b11% and to 2.33 respectively, which can decrease gas reduction and improve the quality of ore magnetic roasting.

The bigger the difference of the Ar3 transformation temperature between the interdendritic regions and the dendritic regions caused by microsegregation is, the easier banded structure formed. The cooling rate in an austenitic transformation and the austenitic grain size were the main factors to form the banded structure. Both the higher cooling rate and the bigger austenitic grain size can eliminate banded structure. The main effects of primary carbide and secondary carbide on the formation of banded structure in hypereutectoid steel were also formulated.

For some newly\ue011established production lines, it was impossible to collect enough samples in a short period of time. This would result in inefficient detection which will affect efficiency in the early stage of a detecting system. In order to solve this problem, an enhanced generative adversarial network was adopted to perform image translation on image samples in other production lines to obtain the defect samples of new production lines, which was also called as cross domain image conversion. The surface defect samples of hot\ue011rolled steel sheets and the non\ue011defective samples of cold\ue011rolled steel strips were fusion\ue011converted into cold\ue011rolled strip surface defects samples. The experiment conducted cross domain conversion on the surface defects of six different types of hot\ue011rolled steel sheets. The results showed that the image conversion results with heavier background texture are better. For some defects with small defect scales, such as pitting, the detection results still have room for improvement. In order to quantitatively determine the detection result, a neural network was introduced to classify the original image and the translated image. The accuracy of classification results reached 96%, indicating that the image cross\ue011domain conversion effect was good and has certain application value.", "keywords_en": ["surface detection", "generative adversarial networks(GANs)", "image translation", "cross domain conversion", "neural network"], "citation": ""}, "http://www.zgyj.ac.cn/CN/abstract/abstract10972.shtml": {"title_cn": "\u8f6c\u7089\u5e95\u5439\u6c2e\u6c29\u5207\u6362\u5bf9\u6c2e\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6570\u5f71\u54cd", "author_cn": "SUN Liang1\uff0cZHAO Zhong\ue011qiu2\uff0cJIA Yi1\uff0cZHAO Xiao\ue011dong1\uff0cQIAO Wei1", "org_cn": "(1.

Results on determination of TWIP steel stacking fault energy from experiment and thermodynamic calculation are different, and the SFE range in which TWIP effect occurs is also not consistent among various studies. It is liable to observe the porosity and segregation defects in as cast TWIP steel because of the large margin between liquidus and solidus. The reduction of area for as cast TWIP steel is below 40%, which possibly leads to dendrites cracks during bending and straightening process in conventional continuous casting. Horizontal continuous casting and twin roll strip casting show distinctive advantages in TWIP steel casting. The temperature range for TWIP steel hot rolling is very narrow which is resulted from the low solidus and weak hot ductility. Annealing temperature and time after cold rolling are still in laboratory research stage. The strengthening mechanism for Fe-Mn-Si-Al TWIP steel is mainly due to the dynamic Hall-Petch effect by deformation twins, while for Fe-Mn-C(-Al) TWIP steel, dynamic strain aging should be the primary factor. Al alloying in TWIP steel is helpful to improve the delayed fracture resistance of TWIP steel, attributed to the \u03b1-Al2O3 layer under specimen surface which can prevent hydrogen diffusion.", "keywords_en": ["", "stacking fault energy", "strengthening mechanism", "delayed fracture"], "citation": ""}, "http://www.zgyj.ac.cn/CN/abstract/abstract10135.shtml": {"title_cn": "\u9178\u3001\u78b1\u6599\u8d85\u539a\u6599\u5c42\u6df7\u5408\u70e7\u7ed3\u8bd5\u9a8c", "author_cn": "WAN Xin-yu1\uff0cL\ue75e Qing1\uff0cCHEN Shu-jun2\uff0cFENG Shuai1", "org_cn": "\uff081.

The laser welding quality mainly depends on the control precision of the main parameters functions, including the welding speed, the laser output power, the focus distance, the welding head pressure, the gaps of the operating side(OS) and the driving side(DS), the second cut amount, and the pre/post heating. The Miebach welder in the No.2 PL- TCM line of Shougang Jingtang United Iron and Steel Co., Ltd. is investigated. Combined with the effective use of the QCDS weld inspection system, series of maintenance actions to ensure the welding quality by improving the function accuracy of laser welder are summarized, the key points and the technical regulations during the welder maintenance are confirmed, and the good performance is obtained. The study could supply important tips for other similar lines to quickly diagnose the bad welding quality due to the lack of the equipment function and accuracy.", "keywords_en": [], "citation": ""}, "http://www.zgyj.ac.cn/CN/abstract/abstract10776.shtml": {"title_cn": "\u5e38\u89c4\u70ed\u8fde\u8f67\u7c97\u8f67\u5de5\u4f5c\u8f8a\u78e8\u635f\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528", "author_cn": "WANG Jing", "org_cn": "\uff082 250 Hot Strip Mill\uff0c Hunan Valin Lianyuan Iron and Steel Co., Ltd., Loudi 417000, Hunan, China\uff09", "abstract_cn": "", "keywords_cn": ["", "", "", ""], "title_en": "Analysis and application of work roll wear of rough mill in hot strip mills", "abstract_en": "Abstract\uff1aThe 2 250 hot- rolled strip mill of Liansteel is a conventional hot- rolling production line designed and manufactured in China with only one roughing mill. The roughing work roll is more worn than the other hot- rolled strip mills with two roughing mills. In order to reduce the roll consumption and the frequency of roll change, the rolling weights of roughing work roll was increased, but it was found that there is an increase of roughing work roll accident and obvious center wave in the upstream stands of finishing mill after operating for some time. Through the data processing and analysis of rolling weights, roll wear and roll consumption of roughing work roll, the mathematical relationship between the three factors was explored. By regulating the rolling weights of roughing work roll, the roll accident reduced by 58.28% and the problem of the center wave appeared in the upstream stands of finishing mill obviously reduced.
