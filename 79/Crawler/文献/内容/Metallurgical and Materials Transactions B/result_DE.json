The dendrite growth velocity of the primary \u03b3 phase varies as a double exponential function with undercooling (\u0394T). The critical undercooling for the transformation of the primary \u03b3 phase from dendrites to equiaxed grains in electromagnetic levitation (EML) and drop tube (DT) experiments is similar. With comparable undercoolings, the grain size of \u03b3 phase solidified in the DT is much smaller than that in the EML owing to the effect of large cooling rate. As the undercooling continuously increases to 230 K, the phase constitution changes from \u03b3 and precipitated phases to single \u03b3 phase.

The compressive and nanomechanical properties of Inconel X750 alloy solidified in EML experiments were also investigated. The results show that the elastic modulus of \u03b3 phase is smaller than that of (Ti, Nb)C phase. According to the compression tests, the elastic modulus of Inconel X750 alloy is improved by high undercooling.

Moreover, the effects of uneven slag films on slab lubrication and heat transfer in the mold are discussed. The results show that the concentrations of MnO and SiO2 over the flux layer have an opposite stair-step distribution, which consists of a reaction layer and nonreaction layer. When the reaction layer thickness is 5 mm, a thicker liquid film is formed between the slab and the mold. The inhomogeneity of the composition in the solid film causes large fluctuations in the heat flux in the mold, resulting in irregular depressions on the shell surface. With a reacting thickness of 10 mm, the reacting slag fills in the gap to generate a thinner solid film, which increases the overall heat flux in the mold. Since mold oscillation combined with slag rim enhances the pressure flow in the vicinity of the meniscus, the liquid slag within 80 mm of the mold wall is mixed and consumed quickly. In contrast, the liquid slag beyond 80 mm from the mold wall with a low velocity stays longer in the liquid pool.

This paper presented a reduction-sulfurization sedimentation process for recovering copper and cobalt from the matte\u2013slag mixture of ISA furnace. Firstly, matte\u2013slag mixture and traditional static sedimentation slag are characterized to determine their mineral composition and occurrence state. It indicates that Cu is primarily lost in slag in the form of sulfide, while Co is mostly lost in the form of oxide. With coke and pyrite as the reducing agent and vulcanizing agent, an orthogonal laboratory experiment was conducted to determine the effects of the smelting temperature and additive dosage on the recovery process. The optimum slag cleaning conditions were found to be: a coke dosage of 2 pct, a pyrite dosage of 2 pct, and a smelting temperature of 1260 \u00b0C lasting for 2 hours. In order to improve on the low utilization ratio of additives associated with the industrial sedimentation process, an innovative additive introducing method was put forward which enables the additives to mix and react with slag more adequately. A powder injection device was purpose-made to inject additives into molten slag in dispersion state, and a laboratory experiment was carried out to simulate this process. By injecting 2 pct coke and 2 pct pyrite, the contents of Cu and Co in cleaned slag decreased to 0.46 and 0.01 pct, respectively.

The meniscus velocities of the liquid increase two- or threefold in two-phase flows regarding one-phase flows using low flow rates of the gas phase. This effect is due to the dragging effects on bubbles by the liquid jets forming two-way coupled flows. Liquid velocities (primary phase) along the narrow face of the mold also are higher for two-phase flows. Flows using nozzle U are less dependent on the effects of the secondary phase (air). The smallest bubble sizes are obtained using nozzle U, which confirms that bubble breakup is dependent on the strain rates of the fluid and dissipation of kinetic energy in the nozzle bottom and port edges. Through dimensionless analysis, it was found that the bubble sizes are inversely proportional to the dissipation rate of the turbulent kinetic energy, \u03b50.4. A simple expression involving \u03b5, surface tension, and density of metal is derived to scale up bubble sizes in water to bubble sizes in steel with different degrees of deoxidation.

The equiaxed phase evolution and the solute transport with effect of fluid flow and grains transport were described in this article. The results show that the equiaxed phase ratio will not increase obviously with higher current intensity of M-EMS, while the negative segregation near the strand surface becomes more serious. The negative segregation zone near the billet center and the center positive segregation come into being with the effect of equiaxed grains sedimentation and liquid thermosolutal flow.

The droplet formation during melting of an electrode under the action of a strong DC current is simulated with a multiphase-magnetohydrodynamic approach. A volume-of-fluid approach is used for the interface tracking, and the potential formulation is used to determine the electric and magnetic fields. The Lorentz force and the Joule heating are recalculated at each time step as a function of the phase distribution. The evolution of the electric resistance of the system during the droplet formation and departure is reported.

The selection of water, W, and air, A, flow rates, and pressures in pneumatic nozzles open up a wide spectrum of cooling possibilities by their influence on droplet diameter, d, droplet velocity, v, and water impact flux, w. Nonetheless, due to the harsh environment resulting from the high temperatures and dense mists involved, there is very little information about the correlation between heat flux extracted, \u2212q, and mist characteristics, and none about the dynamics of drop-wall interactions. For obtaining both kinds of information, this work combines a steady-state heat flux measuring method with a visualization technique based on a high-speed camera and a laser illumination system. For wall temperatures, T w, between ~723 K and ~1453 K (~450 \u00b0C and ~1180 \u00b0C), which correspond to film boiling regime, it was confirmed that \u2212q increases with increase in v, w, and T w and with decrease in d. It should be noticed, however, that the increase in w generally decreases the spray cooling effectiveness because striking drops do not evaporate efficiently due to the interference by liquid remains from previous drops. Visualization of the events happening close to the surface also reveals that the contact time of the liquid with the surface is very brief and that rebounding, splashing, sliding, and levitation of drops lead to ineffective contact with the surface. At the center of the mist footprint, where drops impinge nearly normal to the surface those with enough momentum establish intimate contact with it before forming a vapor layer that pushes away the remaining liquid. Also, some drops are observed sliding upon the surface or levitating close to it; these are drops with low momentum which are influenced by the deflecting air stream. At footprint positions where oblique impingement occurs, frequently drops are spotted sliding or levitating and liquid films flowing in from inner positions are seen generating vapor cushions after having stayed in contact with the surface. Visualization of events taking place under high, ~500 kPa, and low, ~200 kPa, air nozzle pressure, p a, conditions suggests that the considerably larger heat extraction obtained under high p a is related to more frequent impingement of finer and faster drops that result in the formation of a dense fog of tiny secondary drops that moves tangentially close to the surface.", "citation": "Huerta L., M.E., Mej\u00eda G., M.E. & Castillejos E., A.H.

New Al deoxidation equilibria, Al and O contents in liquid iron in equilibrium with solid Al2O3 were measured at 1873 K and 1923 K (1600 \u00b0C and 1650 \u00b0C) over the whole Al composition range, 0.0027 < [pct Al] < 100. In order to secure the deoxidation equilibria, in the present study, the Al deoxidation experiments were carried out by employing three different methods: (1) traditional Al deoxidation by the addition of Al into Fe-O alloys, (2) oxidation of Al in Fe-Al alloys by the addition of Fe2O3 as an oxygen source, and (3) addition of CaO flux for an effective removal of suspended Al2O3 inclusions in liquid alloys containing high Al. In addition, in the present study, the O solubility limit in pure Al melt in equilibrium with solid Al2O3 was also measured in the temperature range from 1673 K to 1873 K (1400 \u00b0C to 1600 \u00b0C). The present experimental results provide a complete set of Al deoxidation equilibria in liquid iron which may be useful for the estimation of residual oxygen level and alumina inclusion formation in high Al steel processing.

The preceding results show the existence of velocity spikes (defined as velocities with magnitudes that exceed the standard deviation of the average velocity) in the submeniscus region. Using the SEN-R ports yields more velocity spikes per minute with larger magnitudes than using the SEN-S, which could be the main cause of the detrimental quality of steel.

Furthermore, using a moving high-speed camera that travels upwards with the bubbles, their properties are quantified in detail along the entire trajectory. In the range of equivalent diameters between 5.9 and 9.0 mm, this reveals a single periodic flow regime in which bubbles follow a sinusoidal path with a characteristic frequency of 3.31 Hz.

SSA is a frequency-domain mathematical method. Based on SSA, two values, the extracting average period value (P ea) and the extracting comprehensive harmonic extent (E ech), have been defined for investigating the periodic characteristics of time series, which reflects the influence of the segregation on the casting-direction quality stability (fluctuation frequency and disorder extent) of the billet. First, it is found that there are different periodic characteristics (period value and harmonic extent) at different positions as to the carbon element distribution along the casting direction in a continuous-casting billet, and the corresponding variation trend with position may be different at different data layouts or at different scales. Moreover, as to the studied element distributions, the variation trends of the period value with position in the same data layout results are the same, but it is different in the same scale results of different data layout; the variation trends of the harmonic extent with position in the same scale results are the same, but it is different in the same data layout results of a different scale.

The results show that the crystallization temperatures of lime-alumina-based mold fluxes are much lower than those of lime-silica-based mold fluxes.

In continuous cooling of lime-alumina-based mold fluxes with high B2O3 contents and a CaO/Al2O3 ratio of 3.3, faceted cuspidine precipitates first, followed by needle-like CaO\u00b7B2O3 or 9CaO\u00b73B2O3\u00b7CaF2. In lime-alumina-based mold flux with low B2O3 content (5.4 mass pct) and a CaO/Al2O3 ratio of 1.2, the formation of fine CaF2 takes place first, followed by blocky interconnected CaO\u00b72Al2O3 as the dominant crystalline phase, and rod-like 2CaO\u00b7B2O3 precipitates at lower temperature during continuous cooling of the mold flux. In B2O3-free mold flux, blocky interconnected 3CaO\u00b7Al2O3 precipitates after CaF2 and 3CaO\u00b72SiO2 formation, and takes up almost the whole crystalline fraction. The casting trials show that the mold heat transfer rate significantly decreases near the meniscus during the continuous casting using lime-alumina-mold fluxes with higher crystallinity, which brings a great reduction of surface depressions on cast slabs. However, excessive crystallinity of mold flux causes poor lubrication between mold and solidifying steel shell, which induces various defects such as drag marks on cast slab.

In this context, the austenite has dendritic growth whereas the graphite grows with a spherical shape. After solidification occurs, the model assumes that the graphite nodules present in the cast iron continue growing since the carbon content in austenite decreases. Once the stable eutectoid temperature is reached, the alloy undergoes the austenite-ferrite transformation. The nucleation of the ferrite takes place at the contour of the spherical graphite nodules where austenite has low carbon concentration. A ferrite shell surrounding the graphite nodules is formed afterward by means of a process governed by carbon diffusion. Then, a ferrite-pearlite competitive transformation occurs when the temperature is below the metastable temperature.

This model avoids some traditional simplifying assumptions. It accounts for both longitudinal and transverse heat transfers in the crucible and does not neglect transient effects.

It has been documented in previous studies that the presence of a subsurface thermocouple causes a disturbance in the local temperature field surrounding the thermocouple. If not accounted for, such discrepancies will lead to errors when evaluating the surface heat flux histories and surface temperatures via IHC models. A technique called the \u201cequivalent depth\u201d technique is proposed as a method to offset the location of the thermocouple and thereby compensate for the effect the thermocouple hole has on the measured temperature. Although the use of the equivalent depth technique results in the correct prediction of the surface heat flux without including the thermocouple hole in the IHC analysis, it does not allow the correct calculation of the surface temperature. This article outlines the simulations and procedure to derive a correlation to determine the correct surface temperature. By quantifying the surface temperature discrepancy between regions with thermocouples and regions without, a correlation is developed and can be used in conjunction with an IHC analysis to correctly predict the surface temperature. A verification of this technique for the characterization of the surface boundary condition using an IHC model with experimentally measured thermal history data is also presented.", "citation": "Franco, G., Caron, E. & Wells, M.

It is proposed that the factors contributing to stray-grain nucleation during initial withdrawal are (1) the magnitude of local, solute-adjusted undercooling and (2) the rapidly changing curvature of the solidification front close to the mold walls during the initial solidification transient. Based upon the calculated local undercooling and experimentally observed stray-grain morphologies, it was concluded that stray grains nucleate near the mold wall around the seed perimeter and behind the columnar dendrites that advance into the bulk liquid ahead of the melt-back zone. These grains then compete during growth with the dendrites originating from the seed. Therefore, the morphological constraints arising from the inclination of the primary dendrites from the seed crystal with respect to the mold wall (converging/diverging/axial \u3008001\u3009) determines the probability of the stray-grain nuclei developing into equiaxed/columnar grains following competitive growth.", "citation": "D\u2019Souza, N., Jennings, P.A., Yang, X.L. et al.

The residence time of metal droplets in the slag crucially influences the productivity. A model for the prediction of trajectory and residence time of metal droplets in slags has been developed based on mechanics and chemical kinetics principles. When there is no decarburization, analysis of the ballistic motion of metal droplets in the slag predicts very short residence times (<1 second). This result demonstrates that when decarburization is very weak, the metal droplets spend a very short time in the slag. This could explain in part the poor kinetic behavior in the end stage of the blow. During active decarburization metal droplets normally become bloated, resulting in a decreased apparent density. Accounting for this, the ballistic model predicts residence times ranging from 10 to 200 seconds, which are much more in keeping with practical experience and previous laboratory studies.

A coulometric titration technique using a galvanic cell employing CaF2 as a solid electrolyte has enabled measurements to be done under very clean and well-defined conditions over the entire range of compositions from highly diluted up to nearly sodium-saturated solutions. Sodium in liquid aluminum of 99.9999 pct purity is found to exhibit strong negative deviation from Henry\u2019s law, corresponding to a large negative self-interaction coefficient \u025b\nNa\nNa\nas expressed by the equation \u025b\nNa\nNa\n=16,318\u2212(191.1\u00b7105 K)\u00b7T \u22121. This behavior is normal for elements, which exhibit strong positive deviation from Raoult\u2019s law and is explained by formation of Na clusters.

Atomic absorption spectrophotometric measurements of Hg loss indicate that in neutral flow, surface oxide films formed in air prior to immersion persist and effectively suppress significant mercury release. In acidic (pH 1) flows, by contrast, oxide films are unstable and dissolve; depending on the amalgam\u2019s material composition, particularly its copper content, two distinct mercury release mechanisms are initiated. In low copper amalgam, high initial mercury release rates are observed and appear to reflect preferential mercury dissolution from unstable Sn8Hg (\u03b3 2) grains within the amalgam matrix. In high copper amalgam, mercury release rates are initially low, but increase with time. Microscopic examination suggests that this feature reflects corrosion of copper from grains of Cu6Sn5 (\u03b7\u2032) and consequent exposure of Ag2Hg3 (\u03b3 1) grains; the latter serve as internal mercury release sites and become more numerous as corrosion proceeds. Three theoretical models are proposed in order to explain observed dissolution characteristics. Model I, applicable to high and low copper amalgams in neutral flow, assumes that mercury dissolution is mediated by solid diffusion within the amalgam, and that a thin oxide film persists on the amalgam\u2019s surface and lumps diffusive in-film transport into an effective convective boundary condition. Model II, applicable to low copper amalgam in acidic flow, assumes that the amalgam\u2019s external oxide film dissolves on a short time scale relative to the experimental observation period; it neglects corrosive suppression of mercury transport. Model III, applicable to high copper amalgam in acidic flow, assumes that internal mercury release sites are created by corrosion of copper in \u03b7\u2032 grains and that corrosion proceeds via an oxidation-reduction reaction involving bound copper and diffusing hydrogen ions. The models appear to capture the correct time dependence of each dissolution mechanism and to provide reasonable fits to the experimental data.", "citation": "Keanini, R.G., Ferracane, J.L. & Okabe, T.

Particle-image velocimetry (PIV) measurements are performed on a 0.4-scale water model to determine the detailed nature of the swirling velocity profile exiting the nozzle. Predictions with the computational model agree well with the PIV measurements. The computational model is suitable for simulating dispersed bubbly flows, which exist for a wide range of practical gas injection rates. The model is used for extensive parametric studies of the effects of casting operation conditions and nozzle design, which are reported in Part II of this two-part article.", "citation": "Bai, H., Thomas, B.G.

Experimental study was carried out to determine the effective viscosities of emulsions of silicone oils of known viscosities (345 and 1010 mPa \u00b7 s at 293 K) with small amounts of water evenly distributed in the same. The viscosities of these emulsions were measured at a constant temperature by the rotating-cylinder method. The uniformity of the preparation of the emulsions was confirmed by the reproducibility of the results. The measured viscosities were generally found to be independent of the torque under the experimental conditions, so that the two-phase mixture could be considered as a Newtonian liquid. The variation of viscosities with temperature and the effect of the addition of a surface-active substance were also studied in this work. The viscosities were found to be higher than those of both pure water and silicone oil. The experimental results were used to examine the applicabilities of the theoretical models developed by Einstein, Taylor, and Oldroyd. It was found that interfacial energy would play an important role in the viscous flow of the two-liquid mixture.", "citation": "Liu, W., Sichen, D. & Seetharaman, S.

Thermal histories of the solidifying shell and the substrate were recorded and used to elucidate the mechanisms of interfacial heat transfer and nucleation. The melt/substrate wetting behavior was shown to be controlled by the melt surface tension. The interfacial heat transfer resistance was controlled by the degree of melt/substrate wetting consequently affecting the heat flux across the interface. According to the classical heterogeneous nucleation theory, improved wetting is expected to reduce the energy barrier for nucleation while increasing the cooling rate of the liquid. Because the overall nucleation rate is controlled by both the rate of cluster formation and the rate of atom transfer to the nucleus, increasing the cooling rate above a critical level is expected to reduce the nucleation rate. The measured experimental data allowed the melt undercooling and the time for nucleation of the first solid phase to be determined and compared to the theoretical predictions. The implications of the mechanisms of nucleation on early shell growth are also considered.", "citation": "Evans, T., Strezov, L.
