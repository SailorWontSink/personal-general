A heat transfer mathematical model of a BF cast steel cooling stave has been developed and verified by thermal state experiments. Calculation of a cooling stave working under steady state has been carried out based on the model. Effects of two factors, thickness of scale on the cooling water pipes and gas clearance between the pipes and main body, which are difficult for experimental measurement but determined mathematically, on the temperature field of the stave body are discussed. The results indicate that much importance should be attached to the two factors during manufacturing of cooling staves as they highly influence cooling capability of cooling stave and hence BF operation.", "keywords": ["COOLING STAVE", "THERMAL STATE EXPERIMENT", "HEAT TRANSFER", "GAS CLEARANCE", "SCALE"]}, "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/174328107X203895": {"title": "Development of low alloy titanium and niobium microalloyed ultrahigh strength steel through electroslag refining", "authors": ["S.

Attempts have been made to develop a special steel by the electroslag refining (ESR) process. The base alloy was prepared with a chemical composition of 0\u00b728C\u20131\u00b70Mn\u20131\u00b70Mo\u20130\u00b735V\u20134\u00b72Cr and a trace amount of S and P. This alloy has displayed yield strength of \u223c 1450 MPa in the quenched and tempered condition with an average austenite grain size of \u223c65 \u03bcm. The mechanical properties were improved further by microalloying with 0\u00b707%Ti and Nb. The yield strengths of Ti and Nb microalloyed steels are 1500 and 1570 MPa respectively, in the as cast quenched and tempered condition. The optical, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) studies confirmed that the microstructure consists of tempered lath martensite. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) carbon replica and EDS analysis showed that the Ti(C,N) and Nb(C,N) precipitates might have helped to reduce the austenite grain size in the Ti and Nb steel. It is interesting to note that due to the smaller size of Nb (C,N), the grain size obtained in the Nb steel is in the range of 22\u201327 \u03bcm compared to 35\u201345 \u03bcm in the Ti steel. The improvement of yield strength in Ti and Nb steel might be due to smaller austenite grains and tempered lath martensite microstructures.", "keywords": ["ESR PROCESS", "ULTRAHIGH STRENGTH STEEL", "MICROALLOYS", "AUSTENITE GRAIN", "GRAIN REFINEMENT", "ZINER PINNING EFFECT", "MECHANICAL PROPERTIES", "CHARACTERISATION"]}, "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/174328108X301679": {"title": "Operating experiences with Corex and blast furnace at JSW Steel Ltd", "authors": ["P.

Bubble behaviour was recorded by a high speed video camera and a volumetric mass transfer coefficient kA/V was used to evaluate the decarburisation rate. Measurement of the volumetric mass transfer coefficient kA/V was made by means of the CO2 desorption from a NaOH solution. Pictures of bubble behaviour show that gas bubbles are generated separately from the multihole orifice in the low region of gas flowrate, but they tend to coalesce at high gas flowrate. It was demonstrated that kA/V increases with increasing gas flowrate and decreasing orifice hole diameter. In the low region of gas flowrate, kA/V for multihole orifices is larger than that for one-hole orifices. In this case, kA/V increases as the number of holes increases, and the hole distance of orifice has little effect on kA/V. However, in the high region of gas flowrate, kA/V for multihole orifices is lower than that for one-hole orifices, and kA/V decreases with the increase in orifice interhole distance. It was found that there exists a critical gas flowrate, above which kA/V for multihole orifices is lower than that for one-hole orifices. This critical value increases with increasing hole distance and hole number.

The result shows that the most important factors affecting hot metal temperature are the hot metal composition, especially carbon content, followed by the burden structure and metallisation of the direct reduced iron from the reduction shaft. In addition, hot metal temperature was related to the flux amount charged into the melter gasifier, slag properties, the tapping process, etc. The statistical model to predict hot metal temperature was obtained by multiple regressions based on the understanding of the operational parameters affecting the hot metal temperature.

However, two main disadvantages still remain in these empirical models. First, most of traditional outlier detection methods for preprocessing the data samples assume that they (approximately) follow a Gaussian distribution and thus may be invalid for some situations. To address this problem, a support vector clustering (SVC) based efficient outlier detection method is proposed whereby the process nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity can be better handled. Second, only using a single global model is insufficient to capture all the process characteristics, especially for those complicated regions. In this paper, a reliable just-in-time modelling method is proposed. The SVC outlier detection is integrated into the just-in-time-based local modelling method to enhance the reliability of quality prediction. A healthier relevant data set is constructed to build a more reliable local prediction model. Moreover, the historical data set is updated repetitively in a reasonable way.
